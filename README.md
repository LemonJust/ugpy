There's nothing yet to use. But if you really-really want to , you can use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install ugpy.

```bash
pip install ugpy
```

## Usage

Please see notebooks/examples on [github](https://github.com/LemonJust/ugpy). I mean .. see them some time later, when I actually make them ...
